# defaults
Default files like configs, settings oder grunt scripts as blueprint for project initializations


## Task Runner

The task runner is implemented via _npm scripts_.

To get a list of all implemented scripts:  
`npm run`



### Trouble Shooting 

- npm scripts needs to be executables    
  `chmod +x ./_tasks/foo.js` or  
  `chmod 755 ./_tasks/foo.js`
